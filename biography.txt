<p>Hello! My name is Alessio Martini. I am a Master's student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam. I previously completed my Bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca. My academic interests include quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and non-equilibrium phenomena. Through my studies, I aim to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</p>
